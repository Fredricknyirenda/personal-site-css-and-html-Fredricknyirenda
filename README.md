I chose a clean and minimal layout with a dark background and bright highlight colors to make the content easy to read and visually appealing. I used simple fonts and clear sections to help users quickly find what they’re looking for.
The most challenging part was making sure everything looked good on.on making sure it works on all devices i was unable to finish due to limited timeg Positioning elements like the fixed card and making sure it didn’t overlap other sections took some time and testing. I also had to spend extra time fixing layout bugs when switching between pages.
I'm proud that I was able to build a full webpage layout using only HTML, CSS. I like how the design turned out — especially the fixed profile card and the smooth scroll between sections. It shows what I’ve learned and how I can apply it to real projects.
